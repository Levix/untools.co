# How to choose the right thinking tool

## **Prompt questions**

When you find yourself in front of a problem, decision or a system, you can ask yourself these prompt questions. They will point you to the right tool for you.

## **Problem-solving tools**

### **Avoid worst scenarios**

If you're working on a high-stakes problem, you might want to focus on specifically avoiding bad solutions.

**[Inversion](https://untools.co/inversion)** is a tool to make you see the problem from a different angle and avoid possible mistakes or bad outcomes.

### **Break the problem down**

It often helps to break big and complex problems into smaller, more manageable ones.

**[Issue trees](https://untools.co/issue-trees)** allow you to do this in a systematic way. It's great to tackle the problem in a "divide and conquer fashion".

Then there are **[first principles](https://untools.co/first-principles)** which focus on identifying the fundamental principles underlying a given problem. You can then build an original solution from these principles rather than from the initial problem statement.

### **Frame the problem differently**

**[Abstraction laddering](https://untools.co/abstraction-laddering)** will help you find alternative and innovative solutions by defining a the right problem (of which your initial problem might only be a subset of). You can **[get a worksheet](https://gumroad.com/l/untools-worksheets)** to get started with this tool.

### **Come up with creative solutions**

**[Productive thinking model](https://untools.co/productive-thinking-model)** gives you a six-step framework that will help you find creative solutions to the problems you're solving. It does that thanks to structured, critical thinking.

## **Decision-making tools**

### **Figure out what kind of a decision you're making**

**[Hard choice model](https://untools.co/hard-choice-model)** is for you seeing the type of decision in front of you so that you can move forward with it more efficiently. If it's a no-brainer, you'll know to make the decision quickly rather than correctly. For hard or big decisions, you might need to dig deeper (tools below will help you).

### **Choose the best option**

**[Decision matrix](https://untools.co/decision-matrix)** is great for **weighing up different factors and identifying the best option**. If you're looking for picking a clear winner based on various factors, this tool is for you.

### **Analyze before you commit**

**[Second-order thinking](https://untools.co/second-order-thinking)** will help you **consider a specific option** and what the deeper or **long-term consequences** of choosing it might be.

**[Ladder of inference](https://untools.co/ladder-of-inference)** is another tool to help you see if there's a gap in your thinking before you commit to a decision. With this tool, you'll avoid jumping to conclusions too early and make decisions based on reality.

There are **[worksheets](https://gumroad.com/l/untools-worksheets)** for both of these tools.

### **Understand the situation before choosing a response**

Sometimes, you need a little time to assess the situation so that you can choose the best response. **[Cynefin framework](https://untools.co/cynefin-framework)** is an excellent tool for that.

It helps you to **categorize a situation and point you to the most appropriate response**.

### **Prioritize**

This is really a subset of decision-making: **"What should I be working on right now?"**

A great prioritization tool is the **[Eisenhower matrix](https://untools.co/eisenhower-matrix)**. It will enable you to prioritize your actions and tasks by importance and urgency. You can get the **[Eisenhower matrix as a worksheet](https://gumroad.com/l/untools-worksheets)** too.

# **Systems-thinking tools**

### **Understand a system**

To **learn more about a system**, I recommend starting with the **[Connection circles](https://untools.co/connection-circles)**.

It's a great tool to map different elements of a system or a story and the relationships between them. You can get started with a **[Connection circles worksheet](https://gumroad.com/l/untools-worksheets)**.

**The key benefit of** **connection circles is that they expose feedback loops** (both **[balancing](https://untools.co/balancing-feedback-loop)** and **[reinforcing](https://untools.co/reinforcing-feedback-loop)** loops). You can then move on to learning about those loops to really understand what's going on in the system.

### **Uncover causes of events**

If you're looking to **uncover the root causes of some event**, use the **[Iceberg model](https://untools.co/iceberg-model)**.

It's a four-level model that allows you to see beyond what's obvious and think about the patterns, structures and mental-models that really drive the surface-level events. There's also a handy **[Iceberg model worksheet](https://gumroad.com/l/untools-worksheets)** to help you.
