# 冲突解决图

**找到冲突的双赢解决方案**

谨慎处理冲突是很重要的，冲突解决图（也叫“消雾法”）是一个工具，它可以帮助你和平地解决冲突，同时确保双方的需求得到满足。

这是 Eliyahu Goldratt 的约束理论发展出来的思维工具之一，让我们看看它是如何工作的。

如何使用它？
-------------

使用这个工具的最佳时机是当你遇到一个冲突而它似乎不可能通过接受任何一方的建议来解决，这可能是与他人的冲突，但也可能是内部的冲突，它可以是专业的，也可以是私人的，你可以在白板上、纸上画出这个图，也可以在脑海中快速想出那个图。

这张图非常简单，由三部分组成：

* 对立双方的要求/建议：这些通常是互斥的，这就是造成冲突的原因
* 双方的基本需求或要求
* 需求背后的共同目标或目的

在这种情况下，你需要反向操作图表——从右到左。

1.  确定双方的论点是什么——要求或建议是什么。
    * 问：对方想做什么？我想做什么？
2.  明确双方立场背后的需求。
    * 问：双方的提议满足了哪些需求？
3.  找出共同的目标：
    * 问：满足双方的需求会有什么好处？
    * 这是最关键的部分，通常双方都想在更高的层次上达成一些共识，但对如何去做有不同的看法，要承认你们是在同一个团队中实现这个目标的。

确定共同的目标对于找到双赢的解决方案是必要的。

Discuss any assumptions that are behind the original proposals – this usually shines the light on the mutual exclusivity that created the conflict.

From here, you can build up a new solution. This time with focus on the shared goal and satisfying the needs of both sides.

And that's why the conflict can be resolved:

1.  peacefully: by looking for what unites both sides.
2.  and productively: by working toward a win-win solution that helps achieve the shared goal.

Example
-------

Let's look at how this could be used in practice. Say you're debating redesigning your product website with your colleague. You're against the project but your colleague is pushing for it. You've been discussing this for an hour without any result. To move on, you suggest to create this conflict resolution diagram.

First, you write down both sides of the argument: redesigning vs not. 

After that, you identify the need behind each approach by discussing why exactly each approach is better. You find out that your colleague needs the website to have a better conversion rate. You're arguing against the project because you want to minimize waste of resources and you see a big risk in such a big project.

Finally, you work together to identify what's the goal you both want to achieve by meeting those needs. You discover that you both want to meet the financial goals of the company. The shared objective is running a profitable business.

This is great progress as now you have something in common to work with. By working from what you have in common, you are able to resolve the conflict and come up with a solution that supports your goal and meets both of your needs: such as running small targeted experiments on your website that can move the needle on conversion rate without using a lot of resources.

It's a simplified example but shows the great benefit of using the conflict resolution diagram: finding win-win solutions.

Put it to practice
